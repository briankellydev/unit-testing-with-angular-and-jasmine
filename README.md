# Unit Tesing With Angular and Jasmine

This project is meant to give boilerplate patterns for common testing scenarios in Angular. It includes tests with components, services, directives, and pipes.

It contains two folders, one with tests for reference and one without to try writing them yourself.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
